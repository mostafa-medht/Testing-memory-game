## Mostafa's Memory Game

In my Fend Udacity course, I had to create a memory game where upon clicked, two cards match and stay open. Once all cards are matched, a Winner message appears and congratulates the tester for winning the game. The Winnwer Message gives a score from 1 to 3, how much time it took, and how many moves it took to finish the game. 


## Installing from Source

1. Clone the following repo: 
  * git clone https://github.com/

2. Load index.html in browser.

3. Play the game

## How to Play:

* The goal is to match all the cards together and win the game.

1. Start by clicking on two cards, if they match, look for another pair of cards. If cards are not a pair, try again.

2. Keep matching up pairs until all cards are matched and faced up. 

3. you have to complete play the game in 20 moves only or U will lose 

4. Congratulations, you win! An alert window appears tell you your score, time, and moves it took to complete the game. If there is an issue with a single card randomly paired, just hit the restart button on the top right corner of the game. 

5. On the Alert window, you can hit 'Go Again!' to have another go at the game, keep playing for the best score and brag off to your friends.
